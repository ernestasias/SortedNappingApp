# SortedNappingApp

This app was made to perform a user experiment using Sorted Napping methodology. (For more info on Sorted Napping: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282482762_Napping_and_sorted_Napping_as_a_sensory_profiling_technique)

In my experiment, users were asked to watch a set of point cloud videos and evaluate how similar/different they are from each other using the Sorted Napping method.
Using a Samsung Galaxy 2 Tablet, they sorted the videos (represented by numbered blocks) through this app. The videos were shown on a separate desktop computer screen.

To read more details about the experiment, please refer to chapter 3 of the following thesis: https://doi.org/10.4233/uuid:d0a8f1b0-d829-4a34-be5a-1ff7aa8679ca
