# SortedNappingApp

This app was made to perform a user experiment using Sorted Napping methodology. (For more info on Sorted Napping: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282482762_Napping_and_sorted_Napping_as_a_sensory_profiling_technique)

In my experiment, users were asked to watch a set of point cloud videos and evaluate how similar/different they are from each other using the Sorted Napping method.
Using a Samsung Galaxy 2 Tablet, they sorted the videos (represented by numbered blocks) through this app. The videos were shown on a separate desktop computer screen.
Screenshots of the app can be found in the directory. 
Screen 1: users were asked to enter their name or userid for the experiment, and were shown instructions performing the experiment on the app.
Screen 2: users were shown a set of blocked numbers that represent the items that they need to group together.
They can drag these blocks to the space bounded by the two axis, and position the blocks based on how they would group them.
When they are finished, they can draw circles around each group, and type in the characteristics of the particular group (the reason they had grouped the items in that group together).

The results from each user are saved in a text file.
